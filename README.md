## Practical List

   Question No.   | Question
:---------------:| -------------
   [Ques 1](QUES&#32;1)        | Design a class Complex having a real part (x) and an imaginary part (y). Provide methods to perform the following on complex numbers:<br/>a) Add two complex numbers.<br/>b) Multiply two complex numbers.<br/>c) toString() method to display complex numbers in the form: x + iy.
   [Ques 2](QUES&#32;2)        | Create  a  class  TwoDim  which  contains  private  members  as  x  and  y  coordinates  in package P1. Define the default constructor, a parameterized constructor and override toString() method to display the co-ordinates. Now reuse this class and in packageP2 createanother class ThreeDim, adding a new dimension as z as its private member. Define the constructors for the subclass and override toString() method in the subclass also. Write appropriate methods to show dynamic method dispatch. The main() function should be in a package P.
   [Ques 3](QUES&#32;3)        | Define an abstract class Shape in package P1. Inherit two more classes: Rectangle in package P2 and Circle in package P3. Write a program to ask the user for the type ofshape and then using the concept of dynamic method dispatch, display the area of the appropriate  subclass.  Also  write  appropriate  methods  to  read  the  data.  The  main() function should not be in any package.
   [Ques 4](QUES&#32;4)        | Create an exception subclass UnderAge, which prints “Under Age” along with the age value when an object of UnderAgeclass is printed in the catch statement. Write a class exceptionDemo in which the method test() throws UnderAge exception if the variable age passed to it as argument is less than 18. Write main() method also to show working of the program.
   [Ques 5](QUES&#32;5)        | Write a program to implement stack. Use exception handling to manage underflow and overflow conditions.
   [Ques 6](QUES&#32;6)        | Write a program that copies content of one file to another. Pass the names of the files through command-line arguments.
   [Ques 7](QUES&#32;7)        | Write  a program  to  read  a  file  and  display only  those  lines  that  have  the  first  two characters as '//' (Use try with resources).
   [Ques 8](QUES&#32;8)        | Write  a  program  to create a  frameusing  AWT. Implement  mouseClicked(), mouseEntered() and mouseExited() eventssuch that:<br/>a)Size of the frame should be tripled when mouse entersit.<br/>b)Frame should reduce to its original size when mouse is clicked in it.<br/>c)Close the frame when mouse exitsit.
   [Ques 9](QUES&#32;9)        | Using AWT, write a program to display a string in frame window with pink color as background.
   [Ques 10](QUES&#32;10)       | Using AWT, write a program to create two buttons named “Red” and “Blue”. When a button is pressed the background color should be set to the color named by the button’s label.
   [Ques 11](QUES&#32;11)       | Using  AWT,  write  a  program which  responds  to  KEY_TYPED  event  and  updates  the status window with message (“Typed character is: X”). Useadapter class for other two events.
   [Ques 12](QUES&#32;12)       | Using AWT, write a program to create two buttons labelled ‘A’ and ‘B’. When button ‘A’ is pressed, it displays your personalinformation (Name, Course, Roll No, College) and when button ‘B’ is pressed, it displays your CGPA in previous semester.
   [Ques 13](QUES&#32;13)       | Rewrite all the above GUIprograms using Swing.
